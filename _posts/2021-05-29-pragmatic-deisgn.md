Sometimes we need to understand which is the good solution for our current issue.

I invented an idea named "Pragmatic-Design". 
Practically instead start with the interface, to inherit and to implements a concrete class. We start only with the empty method and with signature, 
the result is that the code compiles but not work, but we have caught the first feedback from the solution.

Disclaimer:
I think that the correct way is to use interface (etc...) in the major parts of the cases, but with lazy developers, and not expert, 
this technique can be helpful for start in a pragmatic way to manage the design, obv also with tdd,bdd ...


Disclaimer:
These are only my thoughts. These could be totally wrongs, so if you will try to use them, you don't forget about this aspect!
