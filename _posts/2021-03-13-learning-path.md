These it's my learning path! 
- I peek at a book
- I read a book 
- I re-read the book
- I try exercises of what I read in the book
- I annotate and follow the bibliography I buy a book

I return back and repeat 

It's hard? yes! 

Does it keep a long time? yes!
With this process, I learned what's Eiffel what's DbC what's CQS (not CQRS), I learned what's SmallTalk what's the concept behind OOP. 

I am an Eiffel developer? no... 
I am a Smalltalk developer? no absolutely. 
I love this work also for this, continuous learning, continuous improvement, keeping always your feet on the ground, and go forward ...
